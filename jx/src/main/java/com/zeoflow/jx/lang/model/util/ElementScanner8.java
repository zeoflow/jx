/**
 * A scanning visitor of program elements with default behavior
 * appropriate for the {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_8 RELEASE_8}
 * source version.  The <tt>visit<i>XYZ</i></tt> methods in this
 * class scan their component elements by calling {@code scan} on
 * their {@linkplain Element#getEnclosedElements enclosed elements},
 * {@linkplain ExecutableElement#getParameters parameters}, etc., as
 * indicated in the individual method specifications.  A subclass can
 * control the order elements are visited by overriding the
 * <tt>visit<i>XYZ</i></tt> methods.  Note that clients of a scanner
 * may get the desired behavior be invoking {@code v.scan(e, p)} rather
 * than {@code v.visit(e, p)} on the root objects of interest.
 *
 * <p>When a subclass overrides a <tt>visit<i>XYZ</i></tt> method, the
 * new method can cause the enclosed elements to be scanned in the
 * default way by calling <tt>super.visit<i>XYZ</i></tt>.  In this
 * fashion, the concrete visitor can control the ordering of traversal
 * over the component elements with respect to the additional
 * processing; for example, consistently calling
 * <tt>super.visit<i>XYZ</i></tt> at the start of the overridden
 * methods will yield a preorder traversal, etc.  If the component
 * elements should be traversed in some other order, instead of
 * calling <tt>super.visit<i>XYZ</i></tt>, an overriding visit method
 * should call {@code scan} with the elements in the desired order.
 *
 * <p> Methods in this class may be overridden subject to their
 * general contract.  Note that annotating methods in concrete
 * subclasses with {@link java.lang.Override @Override} will help
 * ensure that methods are overridden as intended.
 *
 * <p> <b>WARNING:</b> The {@code ElementVisitor} interface
 * implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the
 * future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures
 * added to future versions of the Java&trade; programming language.
 * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code "visit"} may be
 * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
 * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
 * methods with names beginning with {@code "visit"}.
 *
 * <p>When such a new visit method is added, the default
 * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
 * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new element scanner visitor
 * class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
 * level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
 * visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
 * or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
 *
 * @param <R> the return type of this visitor's methods.  Use {@link
 *            Void} for visitors that do not need to return results.
 * @param <P> the type of the additional parameter to this visitor's
 *            methods.  Use {@code Void} for visitors that do not need an
 *            additional parameter.
 *
